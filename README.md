**Title**: Experimental study on the cost impact and mitigation of mismatching in residential photovoltaic battery energy management systems

**Abstract**: This thesis investigates the cost impact of the mismatching problem in Photovoltaic (PV) battery residential Energy Management Systems (EMS) and explores an optimal frequency-horizon solution. The mismatching problem refers to discrepancies between energy production and consumption, causing inefficiencies. Using a Model Predictive
Control (MPC) EMS model, the study induced mismatching with data from Belgian households. The results show that while mismatching leads to slightly suboptimal
scheduling, its cost impact is relatively small—1% to 8% annual increase—compared to the substantial cost reductions of installing solar panels and adding a battery with
a basic logic controller. Optimal frequency-horizon settings reduced mismatching by 42%, but only decreased annual costs by 0-3%. This work provides key insights and
a foundation for future research on the mismatching problem in EMS.
